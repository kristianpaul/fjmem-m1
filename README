[> About
This is a fjmem compatible core for the Milkymist(tm) One board [1]. It
provides support to program the onboard parallel flash with UrJTAG [2].

[> Requirements
 - Milkymist One board :)
 - UrJTAG compatbile JTAG pod
 - PLD enabled UrJTAG, see [3]
 - Xilinx ISE (WebPack edition is sufficient)

[> Howto
Build the flasher with:
 $ cd boards/milkymist-one/synthesis
 $ make -f Makefile.xst all
This will result in a bitstream which is loaded into the FPGA before
flashing. It provides an interface compatible with the fjmem bus driver of
UrJTAG.

After building and installing UrJTAG start it by
 $ jtag

Execute the following commands on the CLI to program the flash
 cable Turtleizer2 vid=0x0403 pid=0x6010 (this depends on your pod)
 detect
 pld load /path/to/system.bit (eg. build/system.bit)
 initbus fjmem opcode=000010
 detectflash 0
 flashmem 0 /path/to/system.bin
Only binary files are supported by UrJTAG atm.

[> Debugging
LED1 should blink with approx. 1Hz after loading the bitstream.
LED2 toggles with a transition to the DR_UPDATE state of the TAP state
machine.
